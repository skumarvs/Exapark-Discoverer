Forked Version  of Exapark Service Discoverer

Instances are tagged by a tag named Group (Group=Cluster1).With customized version of Open source Exapark Server
Discoverer; the instance which runs the exapark discover service gets the tag group value of the current instance and  
get the privates ips of only the running instances that belongs to the same group value and automatically registers any

Benefits:
Not all the running ec2 instances private ip addresses are updated to the host file. Only instances belong to the group
knows eachother and communicate. And eliminates the necessity of ipaddress of all  the running instances.

By this way we form a cluster among the instances and nodes are discovered for the cluster


Also the linux scripts is updated as a service to start/stop and to get the status.
